MAC/Serial of Pi is used to find

	/var/lib/tftpboot/{id}/
		(this symlink is points to the /boot folder)

	In the above folder, cmdlin.txt lists the NFS mount folder
		Ex : pawz.cattech.org:/var/lib/tftpboot/garagepi_root
			(this is /)

	In the root filesystem /boot is mapped via fstab to the tftpboot/{id} folder

To regenerate the SSH keys for each install (Probably only works if a Pi is hosting which we're not doing)

	cd /var/lib/tftpboot/{id}/
	sudo mount --bind /dev dev
	sudo mount --bind /sys sys
	sudo mount --bind /proc proc
	sudo chroot .
	rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
	dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
	exit
	sudo umount dev sys proc
